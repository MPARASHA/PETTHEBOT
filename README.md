# PETTHEBOT
IRC twitch bot I created for fun. 

## Available commands are:
* % \<INPUT> - gives a random percentage and pings the user
* !love \<INPUT> - Command output looks like : There is \<PERCENTAGE>% love between \<USER> and \<INPUT>
* !joke -  Outputs a joke from the dataset collected from r/jokes
* !scareme - Outputs a two sentence horror story from the dataset collected from r/twosentencehorror
