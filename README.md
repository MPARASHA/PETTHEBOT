# PETTHEBOT
IRC twitch bot I created for fun. 

## Available commands are:
* % <INPUT> - gives a random percentage and pings the user
* !love <INPUT> - Command output looks like : There is <PERCENTAGE>% love between <USER> and <INPUT>
* !joke -  Outputs a joke from the dataset collected from r/jokes
